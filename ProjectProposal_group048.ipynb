    "GPA: The increasingly failing courses can lead students to feel overwhelmed when repeating foundation courses, and the overwhelming amount of piled up work will cause students to feel stressed and unmotivated. Also, for that reason, the students will struggle with paying up for an extra year of school and feel like the major that they chose is not suited for them anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we understand that GPA is a good measure in how a student is performing academically, low academic performance may not be the only reason behind a college’s retention rate. Other factors may include students transferring-out or dropping out for other reasons, perhaps pertaining to students’ choice in major. \n",

    "The ideal dataset we would use to analyze this question would be one that includes the GPA’s of college students as well as the Major Department they belong to. From this dataset, we should also see whether or not these students ended up graduating from that college. Other factors we might want to consider could be their family income or demographic to see if either of those possibly had an effect on the retention rates of students. Finally, data that includes whether or not the student had any financial aid, from the university or outside sources, would be beneficial to seeing whether or not it was a factor in a college’s retention rate. \n"
