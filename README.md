This is a fork of the group repo for our final analysis project for COGS 108 thati did in collaboration with Alex Cheng, Terence Ting, Thomas Kolinek, and Yicong Guo.

The class required the submission of multiple checkpoints in the form of Jupyter notebooks that would be submitted through the course of the quarter. These detailed our basic process of coming up with a proposal for our final project, an overview of the databases we would use for our analysis, another overview of the exploratory data analysis techniques that were planned for use in our project, and finally the final submission.
