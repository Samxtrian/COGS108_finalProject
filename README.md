This is a fork of the group repo for our final analysis project for COGS 108 that I did in collaboration with Alex Cheng, Terence Ting, Thomas Kolinek, and Yicong Guo.

The COVID-19 pandemic had redefined the significance of the college experience due to mandatory online learning so we chose to focus on a project that explored the relationship between the popularity of oneâ€™s major and the subsequent rate of employment that these graduates were met with. We looked at the number of graduates declaring a particular major, the corresponding counts of male and female graduates, the number of graduates that were employed, and also the counts of graduates working jobs requiring and not requiring college degrees.

The class required the submission of multiple checkpoints in the form of Jupyter notebooks that would be submitted through the course of the quarter. These detailed our basic process of coming up with a proposal for our final project, an overview of the databases we would use for our analysis, another overview of the exploratory data analysis techniques that were planned for use in our project, and finally the final submission in the given files in the corresponding order.
